# CRYPTO_INFO_ETL
## Runs every hour<br>
#
**Purpose**
- To strengthen my ETL skills using some real world data, creating a pipeline that is fully automatic and hosted in cloud environments.
- To enhance or challenge my skillset through trying new things.
#
**Dataset**
- In this project I've not worked on any kind of pre-existing dataset.
- In fact I've created my own database, and structure my tables accordingly, that suits my needs and are future proof.
- I've only considered top 10 cryptocurrencies that too on 1st Feb. There are two tables in my database.
- The Top 10 Table acts as a Dimension Table and the other table works as Main Table.
